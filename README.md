## Instructions

Your goal is to work with your team to build an ecommerce store. The theme of your store and what you sell is up to you! Your store should have the following features. Each member of your team must complete AT LEAST ONE of the below features:

- navbar with at least 5 different links to different categories/options
- category pages (categories are things like mens, womens, etc.) that display all of the products of that particular category. Each category should have at least 6 products
- individual product page that displays information about a product (including title, price, description, image(s)). when you click on a product in the category page, you should be taken to the individual product page
- homepage/landing page that can either link to specific featured products/categories, or just be a general landing/introduction page for you store
- A footer with some contact information about your group/the store
- professional looking design and interface ([fab.com](https://fab.com/) is a good example of a clean looking store interface)
- data stored in a 'data.js' file, similar to the Good Burger app

**Bonuses:**
- a way to sort your products by things like price or popularity
- a way to search through your products and display search results
- a 'cart' that saves items users want to buy, and a way for users to add specific products to their cart

**Things to think about:**
- How should you break up responsibilities within your group? Who should be responsible for making what?
- How should you go about building your app? What should you start with? What order should you do things in?
- How are you going to collaborate and share code?
